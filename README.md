### About

This program find the best words (technically, not *the* best but very good words) in order to
find the word of a Wordle game.

The program use entropy in order to find the word that maximise entropy, it find the word
which maximise the average score (the probability of the word + number of guess from the entropy
remaining (using the formula `0.9 ln(entropy remaining) + 1.5`, find by regression with french words
of 5 letters)).
It also take in account the frequency of a word in order to favour more likely words (using
the formula: `weight = tanh(frequency * 3 - 2) + 1` with the frequency in occurrences per
million (of the lemma for the french dictionary)).
